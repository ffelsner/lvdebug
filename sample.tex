\section{A short story}

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel
the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls
like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense
of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
